## Interview Guide for Pet Owners

## About This Document

Use these questions to interview your roommate (and any other pet owners) to validate the Vet Decision Tool concept. The goal is to understand:
1. How real the problem is
2. Current behavior and workarounds
3. Willingness to pay
4. Feature preferences

## Interview Structure

**Time:** 15-30 minutes
**Setting:** Casual conversation, not a formal survey
**Recording:** Ask permission to take notes

---

## Part 1: Understanding the Problem (5-10 min)

### Recent Experience

> "Tell me about the last time you weren't sure if you should take one of your pets to the vet."

**Follow-ups:**
- What were the symptoms?
- How long did you wait before deciding?
- What did you actually do? (Went to vet? Waited it out? Called someone?)
- How did it turn out?
- How much did it cost (if they went)?

### Decision-Making Process

> "Walk me through how you normally decide if something is an emergency vs. wait-and-see."

**Follow-ups:**
- Do you Google symptoms? What sites do you use?
- Do you call the vet's office? Do they help?
- Do you ask friends/family for advice?
- How much time does this process take?
- How stressful is it on a scale of 1-10?

### Frequency

> "How often does this happen — where you're not sure if you should go to the vet?"

- Once a week?
- Once a month?
- A few times a year?

### The Anxiety Angle

> "What symptoms freak you out the most? What makes you drop everything and go immediately?"

> "On the flip side, what symptoms do you monitor at home? How do you decide when 'monitoring' becomes 'time to go'?"

---

## Part 2: Current Solutions (5 min)

### Existing Tools

> "Have you ever used any apps or websites to help with pet health decisions?"

If yes:
- Which ones?
- What did you like about them?
- What was frustrating?
- Do you still use them?

If no:
- Why not?
- What would make you try one?

### Telehealth Experience

> "Have you used pet telehealth services like Pawp, Vetster, or similar?"

If yes:
- Which one?
- How was the experience?
- How much did it cost?
- Would you use it again?

If no:
- Have you heard of them?
- What's stopping you?

### Vet Relationship

> "Do you have a regular vet? How easy is it to get advice from them without a visit?"

---

## Part 3: The Product Concept (5-10 min)

### Initial Reaction

> "I'm thinking about building an app that uses your phone camera to help assess your pet's symptoms. You'd point the camera at your pet, and an AI would guide you through checking things like gum color, eye discharge, mobility — kind of like FaceTiming a vet tech friend who can see what you're seeing. Based on what it sees and your answers, it would tell you if this seems like an emergency, something to watch, or okay to monitor at home."

**Ask:**
- What's your first reaction to that?
- Does it sound useful?
- What concerns would you have?

### Trust Factor

> "Would you trust an AI's assessment? What would make you trust it more or less?"

**Probes:**
- Would disclaimers matter? ("This is not medical advice")
- Would knowing a vet reviewed the logic help?
- What if it always erred on the side of caution?

### The Camera Element

> "How would you feel about an app that wants to look at your pet through your camera while asking questions?"

- Helpful or creepy?
- Any privacy concerns?
- Would video feel different than photos?

### Willingness to Pay

> "If this app existed and was helpful, how much would you pay for it?"

Options:
- Free with ads?
- One-time $5-10?
- Subscription $2-3/month?
- Free, and I'd pay when I actually need a real vet referral?

> "Would you pay more or less if it was from a known brand vs. an indie developer?"

### Feature Prioritization

> "Which of these features would be most valuable to you?"

Rate 1-5:
- [ ] Visual guidance ("show me their gums")
- [ ] Urgency score (emergency vs. wait)
- [ ] Save session history for vet reference
- [ ] Reminders to check again in X hours
- [ ] Connect to real vet if needed
- [ ] Track symptoms over time
- [ ] Multiple pet profiles

### Alternatives

> "Is there anything you'd rather have than this app? What would be the ideal solution?"

---

## Part 4: Specifics for Multi-Pet Households (5 min)

Since your roommate has 7 pets:

> "With 7 pets, do you feel like you're making these 'should I go to the vet' decisions more often than average?"

> "Do you feel more or less confident about assessing symptoms after having so many pets?"

> "Do different species need different approaches? Would an app need to handle dogs vs cats vs [other species they have] differently?"

> "Would you want one profile per pet, or is that overkill?"

---

## Part 5: Closing (2 min)

> "If I built this app and wanted you to try it, would you? What would make you say yes or no?"

> "Is there anything I didn't ask about that you think is important for me to know?"

> "Would you be willing to try an early version and give feedback?"

## Red Flags to Watch For

Signs the product might not work:

- "I'd never trust an AI for this" (trust barrier too high)
- "I just call my vet" (problem already solved)
- "I don't really worry about it" (problem not painful enough)
- "I wouldn't pay anything for this" (no willingness to pay)
- "The camera thing is weird" (UX doesn't resonate)

Signs the product has potential:

- "I Google everything and get scared" (current solution sucks)
- "I've spent $X on unnecessary vet visits" (real cost)
- "That would save me so much stress" (emotional value)
- "I'd definitely try that" (early adopter)
- "Can I sign up now?" (strong signal)

## After the Interview

2. Identify 2-3 biggest insights
3. Update the product spec if needed
4. Consider: Does this validate or invalidate the concept?
