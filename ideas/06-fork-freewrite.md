Freewrite has a lot of the features I like. I really enjoy the style. I think this is what I want to pivot my WestWing idea into. 

But I need to to update the prompt file to run a script to divide into multiple tasks. Right now I want to research if Notion is the best way to build this or n8n. 

what I want:
- Calendar events
- pomodoro feature (maybe seperate app?)
- updating my relationships.csv

want to think through more flows..
